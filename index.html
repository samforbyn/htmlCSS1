        <p>
            I'm 21 years old, I have a love for technology, problem solving, analytical thinking, as well as understanding how and why things work. 
            Currently I am a student developer, with hopes of being able to develop applications and/or systems using Python full time. 
            I strongly believe that to expand, increase, or build upon a knowledge base you must immerse yourself into that environment. 
            You're not going to get better at cycling if you only ride your bicylce one a week. Same for playing any sport, learning any subject, or bettering yourself in any way, really... To truly progress at a satisfactory rate - immersing yourself through repitition and consistency will take you where you need to be.
            We're limited by time. A proverb that always resonated with me is:
            “The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is now.”
            So take that next step, plant that tree now. You'll be grateful in 20 years!
